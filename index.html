        <h1> What are Harmony (ONE) and Zilliqa (ZIL)? </h1>
        <h2> Explanation of ONE & ZIL </h2>
        <p id="number-one"> Harmony is a blockchain platform designed to facilitate the creation and use of decentralized applications (DApps). The network aims to innovate the way decentralized applications work by focusing on random state sharding, which allows creating blocks in seconds. </p>
        <p id="number-one number-two"> Zilliqa is a public, permissionless blockchain that is designed to offer high throughput with the ability to complete thousands of transactions per second. It seeks to solve the issue of blockchain scalability and speed by employing sharding as a second-layer scaling solution. The platform is home to many decentralized applications, and as of October 2020, it also allows for staking and yield farming. </p>

            <h3> Zilliqa (ZIL) </h3>
            <p> I certainly believe Zilliqa (ZIL) will be priced higher than Harmony (ONE) by the end of this bull cycle. </p>

            <h4> Harmony (ONE) </h4>
            <p id="padding-experiment"> Currently, Harmony (ONE) is priced higher than Zilliqa (ZIL). Only time will tell which one will have the greatest ROI. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="example1">
            <p> Perhaps a block on a blockchain could look something like the width and height here, respectively. I wonder what a block actually looks like. Taking it back to my geometry days, would it look like a perfect square? Or would it look like a rectangle? (which can also be a square) Maybe it is better to focus on more important questions... but someone has to ask them! </p>

            <h1> Zilliqa & Harmony </h1>
            <p id="title-p"> What is my price prediction for EOY 2021? I am a firm believer both of these will be well over $1. Only time will tell! </p>
